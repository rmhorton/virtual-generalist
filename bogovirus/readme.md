# Bogovirus simulation

This is a simple simulation of outcomes from a viral infection, designed to produce data from which we can learn causal models where we know what the correct answer should be, or use those models to create analytical simulations.

These are the online versions of the notebooks:

- [Bogovirus BN analytical simulation](https://rmhorton.github.io/virtual-generalist/bogovirus/S2_Bogovirus_simsim_notebook.html)
