## `bnlearn` example

 * `bnlearn_example.Rmd`
 
  - This is an RMarkdown file that implements a simple data simulation based on a published Bayes net example, then trains a Bayes net on the simulated data.

  - The round-trip from Bayes net to simulation back to Bayes net shows that we get (more or less) the same probabilities back that we started with.

  - Shows an example of conditional independence between variables.
