# Introduction to Data Science with Simulated EMR Data

This collection contains open source educational materials (mostly Databricks notebooks) for introducing fundamental concepts of data science to a clinical audience. We focus on exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretable machine learning (ML) models on the assumption that these will be particularly useful skills to clinician data scientists who will play a major role in providing guidance in planning, oversight of research, and sanity checking of findings in the projects they undertake.

The data for these exercises was generated by Synthea using the standard collection of modules. ML is most useful in situations where classifications or predictions of outcomes must be made on the basis of many weak associations; if they can be made based on a small number of strong associations, you probably don't need ML. In many cases, Synthea data lacks the subtle statistical relationships among variables that would make for compelling machine learning demonstrations. The missing subtlety is manifested in both weak associations that are not included in the simulation, but also in overly significant associations among the features that are included. This makes some outcomes impossible to predict, while others can be predicted with far too great certainty.

However, the same assortment of statistically inappropriate relationships that make it difficult to demonstrate ML on this data make it a rich field for sanity checking! Clinicians will easily be able to identify associations between disorders, treatments, observations, and patient characteristics that are either suspiciously strong or conspicuously absent.

After negotiating this field of potential pitfalls, we are able to identify a set of features correlated (but not too strongly correlated) with a clinical outcome, which lets us demonstrate a machine learning classifier. The model we use is an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a form of generalized additive model that comes with its own visualization tools for understanding the contribution of each feature to the prediction.
